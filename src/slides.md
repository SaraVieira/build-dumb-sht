# "Useless is not worthless" - [@devdevcharlie](https://twitter.com/devdevcharlie)

# Why do we build things?

---

### Because they will change the world

---

### Because they will change the world
### Because they will make us rich

---

### Because they will change the world
### Because they will make us rich
### Because they will help us learn

# Because they will change the world

# Is that even good?

# Making people smile

# By building dumb shit

---

# Because they will make us rich

---

## I can't really help you there

---

## I wouldn't be wearing primark clothes and living in a tiny t1 if I could

---

#  NEXT
---

# Because they will help us learn

---

## You learn better when making something you like

---

<img src="../assets/todo.png" />

---

# I have learned so much by making dumb things

---

# I wanted to learn AJAX

---

<img src="../assets/raining.png" />

---

# I wanted to learn how to make postCSS plugins

---

<img src="../assets/postcss.png" />

---

# And then babel

---

<img src="../assets/babel.png" />

---

# I wanted to learn socket.io

---

# Sometimes I just wanna make fun of our world

---

<img src="../assets/npm.png" />

---

<img src="../assets/shit.png" />

---

# You get the idea

---

## All these things I did made me a better dev

---

## They got me hired as a developer advocate

---

## None of them changed the world or made me rich

---

## But they gave me the skills to work on bigger things

---

## Things I believe make the world better

---

## Things like CodeSandbox

---

## Things like teaching people

---

## Things like speaking about mental health

---

## There is so much value in dumb shit

---

## You never know your impact

---

## I wasn't aware of how huge my privilege is

---

## What I saw as normal people saw as brave

---

## People saw as a safe space

---

## Not everyone has the protection we both have in our countries

---

## There is so much value in anything that makes another human smile

---

## Make dumb things to learn

---

## Make dumb things so you can make the world a better place

---
