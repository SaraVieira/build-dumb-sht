## All these things I did made me a better dev

---

## They got me hired as a developer advocate

---

## None of them changed the world or made me rich

---

## But they gave me the skills to work on bigger things

---

## Things I believe make the world better

---

## Things like codesandbox

---

## Things like teaching people

---

## Things like speaking about mental health

---

## There is so much value in dumb shit

---

## There is so much value in anything that makes another human smile

---

## Make dumb things to learn

---

## Make dumb things so you can make the world a better place
